GilCC
=====

A tool to colorize GCC compiler output.


GilCC is a Ruby program that will colorize the output from any compiler such as GCC. 
So if you are a GCC user you probably realized that it is very hard to tell "warnings" 
and "errors" from other texts. GilCC was written to resolve this issue. Very handy specially 
if you cannot upgrade your GCC version to the latest. 
GilCC is open source so it is free to download under MIT license. Colorize GCC use GilCC.
